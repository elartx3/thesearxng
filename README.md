# TheSearXNG - Gateway and UI
The gateway and UI for SearXNG from TheDoggyBrad Software Labs.

## How does this project work?
1.) I carefully selected the following SearXNG instances based on its performance results on searx.space listed below to be randomly selected everytime you search so that your search data will not be focused on a single server. The criteria I used can be located below.<br>
2.) If you are familar on benbusby's farside on [https://farside.link/](https://farside.link/), it is the inspiration of this project. It randomly selects the instance that you will be using to do the search. But the difference of this project is that this uses PHP on Vercel while Farside uses Elixir programming language and of course the logic and its algorithm. Since I am not knowledgeable in Elixir, I cannot discuss the difference of our logics and algorithms but this project only randomly selects my carefully selected instance.<br>
3.) You can both use the UI and the Search URL that you can add to your browser as a default search engine.

## The Search URL

### For Web Browsers' Search Engine Page
https://thesearxng.vercel.app/search?q=%s

### For Normal Direct Searching
https://thesearxng.vercel.app/search?q=(Replace with your Search Query)

## The UI
Just visit https://thesearxng.vercel.app/ to start the exploration of the web using SearXNG!

## Last time and date of selection/revisit of selected SearXNG Instances
12:00 PM - August 30, 2024 (UTC+8)
